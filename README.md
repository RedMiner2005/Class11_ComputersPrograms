# Class11_ComputersPrograms
 This repository contains (almost) all the programs we have covered in Computer classes, along with simpler (sometimes that just means short, not actually simple) version of some of the programs, most of which were made becasue there were obvoius ways to optimize the code, with what we had learnt in class by then.
