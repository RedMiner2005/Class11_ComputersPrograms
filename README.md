# Computers - Programs from the Textbook - Class 11
This repository contains (almost) all the programs we have covered in Computer classes, along with simpler (sometimes that just means short, not actually simple) version of some of the programs, most of which were made because there were obvious ways to optimize the code, with what we had learnt in class by then.

The files are classified in folders as so: ChapterName/[Book/MySimplerVersions]/ChapterNumber_QuestionNumber.py (Exceptions - Chapters 4 and 5 - Files are classified by date and program number on that day)
The abbreviations PI and SQ signify 'Practical Implementation' and 'Solved Questions' respectively
